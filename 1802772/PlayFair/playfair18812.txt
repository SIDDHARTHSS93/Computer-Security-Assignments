#We will ask User to Enter E for Encryption and D for Decryption into variable Choose

If User Selects E:
#We will make alist Key List,that will take the input we provide at Key and enter unique characters once followed by the remaining characters in alphabet except J
#We will Use Keymatrix to display keylist as 5*8 Matrix
#We will Enter the Plain Text Message into message
#We remove spaces and make Key and Message Upper Case 
#We use count variable to denote odd or even number of blocks 0=even, 1=odd
#If last character makes Message into odd number of characters add Z to make the message even, if last character is already Z Insert Q inot message.
#If last character makes Message into odd number of characters add Z to make the message even.
#If the ith and i+1th Character is same, insert X after ith character  
#If the ith and i+1th Character is X, insert Y after ith character   
#Replace J with I
#Traverse through the message, if message is found in key, take the values of ith and i+1th Character into values value 1, value2,and value 3,value4 Respectively
#if both characters fall in same Row in Key Matrix, if value is not the last column, take value2+1th and value4+1th Column into ciphertext
#if both characters fall in same Column in Key Matrix, if value is not the last Row, take value1+1th and value3+1th Row into ciphertext
#if both characters are in different rows and columns of the key matrix, form a rectange, and take the other ends of the rectangle into ciphertext
#Display Cipher Text

if User Selects D
#We will make alist Key List,that will take the input we provide at Key and enter unique characters once followed by the remaining characters in alphabet except J
#We will Use Keymatrix to display keylist as 5*5 Matrix
#We will Enter the Cipher Text Message into ciphertext
#We remove spaces and make Key and ciphertext Upper Case
#We will search ciphertext's ith and i+1th value with key matrix, and if found store the 1st value positions into value 1 and value 2 and 2nd value's positions into value3 and value4
#if both characters fall in same Row in Key Matrix, if value is not the last column, take value2-1th and value4-1th Column into message
#if both characters fall in same Column in Key Matrix, if value is not the last Row, take value111th and value311th Row into message
#if both characters are in different rows and columns of the key matrix, form a rectange, and take the other ends of the rectangle into message
#If last character is Q and the 2nd last character is  Z remove Q, if last character is Z and 2nd last character is something else, remove Z
#If ith value and i+2th value is same and X lies in i+1th value remove X
#print message
