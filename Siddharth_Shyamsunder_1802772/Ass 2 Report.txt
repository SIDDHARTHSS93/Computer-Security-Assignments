Q1)Combined Congruential method
#We will store the values of private keys into private 1 and 2, private 1 and 2
#will be the output of combined congruential method.
#We will have alpha and q to obtain the public keys(x1 and x2) for the Diffie
#Hellman's Algorithm.
#we will use public keys x1 and x2 to generate secret key.
#variables y1 and y2 2 random numbers intermediate values in the combined
#congruential algorithm.
#variables a1,a2,m1 and m2 are used to generate y1, y2, and x.
#x holds the list of each generator value, or each private key in this case.

Q2)Diffie Hellman's Algorithm
#Once the private keys are generated. We will use private keys in the formula
#X=a**private key mod q, where X is the public key x1 and x2,and 
#the private keys are what we generated earlier.

#Once we generate public keys x1 and x2 we will use them to generate secret keys,
#we will use secret key=X**opp private mod q.
#where opp private key is the opposite private key used. 

Q3)RC4 Algorithm Encryption
#Once Secret key is generate, we will divide it into its individual characters.
#This is going to be used to generate list T.
#We will ask user to enter a file name. This file will contain plain text which
#we will convert to cipher text.
#Also the 2nd user will enter the secret key, this is used to confirm that the
#2nd user is genuine.
#We will take the plaintext from the block and divide it into 64 bit blocks
#In this case 8 characters, as each character is 8 bits in length.
#if all blocks are of equal sizes, we will take the last block, else we will take the 2nd last block. 
#We will create list s contsining a range from 0-255, and t which will
#contain our secret key value as discussed earlier.  
#we will find j as a value of j+s[i]+t[i] mod 256 and swap s[i] and s[j]
#In the end we get a new s array. Now we will give new values for i and j and again swap s[i] and s[j]
#In the end we get a new s array. Now we will give new values for i and j and again swap s[i] and s[j]
#we will take the last value as s[t] and store it in k. This k will be used to encrypt the block of plaintext
#We will then take key k and xor with the ascii value of plain text, and convert the new integer list to a character string
#This new character String is the cipher text.

Q4)RC4 Algorithm Decryption
#We will ask the user to provide cipher text. We will use the cipher text to generatean integer matrix.
#We will use the key k to xor the cipher text back to plain text.
